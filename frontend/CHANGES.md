# PYRAMID SCHEME™ — CHANGELOG

---

## v1.24 — Real invite flow + WebSocket push

> *Removes mock recruits for authenticated users. Recruits now arrive in real-time via WebSocket when real users in your downline buy in. The SEND SCROLL button sends an actual invite email.*

### `game/ws.js` (new)
WebSocket client module.  Connects to `ws://host/ws?token=JWT` after auth, auto-reconnects with exponential back-off, sends keep-alive pings every 25 s.  Dispatches all server events onto the `Events` bus as `ws:<type>`.  Singleton exported as `gameSocket`.

### `main.js`
- `gameSocket.connect(token)` called after login.
- `ws:recruit_joined` → calls `addRecruit(name, depth, parentRec, { dbId })` so the pyramid appears in the world in real time.
- `ws:state_update` → updates `G.bought`, `G.earned`, `G.invitesLeft` and re-renders HUD.
- `ws:invite_accepted` → logs that an invitee has registered; refreshes invite panel.
- Loads and renders the invite panel (`Api.getInvites()`) immediately after login.

### `game/recruits.js`
- **`addRecruit(name, depth, parentRec, opts = {})`** — accepts optional `opts.dbId`. After slot assignment, calls `Api.patchRecruitMeta(dbId, layout)` so the server record gets the visual coordinates. No longer calls `Api.saveRecruit` (removed — server creates Recruit rows during buy-in).
- **`recruitFriend()`** — for authenticated users: opens the `showPrompt` email modal, calls `Api.sendInvite(email)`, updates `G.invitesLeft` from the server response, refreshes the invite panel. Guest/demo mode unchanged (random-name mock recruit).
- **`scheduleSubRecruits`** — returns immediately for authenticated users. Mock cascading recruits are guest-only demo behaviour. Real sub-recruits arrive from the server when real chain members buy in.
- **`buyIn()`** now calls `Api.buyIn()` for both auth'd and guest users (guest still works via stub path).

### `game/api.js`
- `sendInvite(email)` → `POST /api/invites`
- `getInvites()` → `GET /api/invites`
- `patchRecruitMeta(dbId, layout)` → `PATCH /api/recruits/{id}/meta`
- `patch()` HTTP verb helper added.
- `saveRecruit()` removed (server-side responsibility now).

### `ui/modal.js`
- `showPrompt(title, body, placeholder)` — single-input modal returning a `Promise<string|null>`. Used by `recruitFriend()` for email capture.

### `ui/panels.js`
- `updateInvitePanel(invites)` — renders the "INVITES SENT" panel with email addresses and ✓ JOINED / ⏳ PENDING status badges.

### `ui/auth.js`
- Reads `?invite=TOKEN` from the URL on load.
- If present: auto-switches to the Register tab, passes `invite_token` in the register request.
- Clean registration URL: the `?invite=...` param stays in the address bar but doesn't affect gameplay.

### `index.html`
- Added `#invites-panel` / `#invite-list` section in the right panel (hidden until user has sent at least one invite).
